# Weather-Forecasting-with-Regressor

In this project, we'll predict tomorrow's temperature using python and historical data. We'll start by downloading a dataset of local weather, which you can customize to where you live!

Here i'm using Los Angeles International Airport weather data because it has a complete parameter.
The data is from https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/ which has an up-to-date world wide data.

We'll clean the data and get it ready for machine learning. We'll build a system to make historical predictions, and add more predictors to improve the model.  We'll end with how to make next-day predictions.
